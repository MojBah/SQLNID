- Prevent duplicate national codes.
- Search for a user by national code.
- View all users in a sortable table.
- All data is stored locally in an SQLite database (`user.db`).

## How to Use
1. Run the script with Python:
   ```
   python sqlfinal.py
   ```
2. Enter user details and click "افزودن کاربر" to add a user.
3. Click "جستجو با کد ملی" and enter a national code to search.
4. The table at the bottom shows all users.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (Tkinter is included by default)

## Language
